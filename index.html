<h2 class="title lobster">Hello!</h2>
<p class="tangerine">Welcome to my sample site! I'd like to thank you for your time and consideration. I am a Website Developer with an Associate in Applied Science from Midlands Technical College in Computer Technology and I have also done some study in Application Development. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET when it comes to website development. I also have some experience in Java and Visual Basic in Application Development. I am constantly trying to learn how to master these languages as well as learn new ones. I have included a few Web Applications in my Work Samples sections and will be adding more soon, but first, please meet my family</p>
